## Description 
The mission of this project was to create a burger application using Express, MySQL, and Handlebars. The application asks for user input on what type of hamburgers they would like to order. The hamburgers are stored in a database called burgers. They can then devour the hamburger, where it is then moved to a devoured list. You can delete the hamburgers in the devoured list or leave them. For this application I used the MVC (model, view, controller) framework. For the model I used a MySQL database and connection. For the views I used Handlebars from Express. For the controller (server) I used Express.
